# Big Data Spark Starter

This is the starter project for the Spark work you will do for Big Data and Machine Learning.
I have set this project up with an appropriate sbt configuration for the assignments that will
be done in this class.


Data Set Report #1

https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/65o7py/updated_reddit_comment_dataset_as_torrents/

For the first data set I've chosen an archive of /all/ comments ever made on reddit up through March of 2017. Obviously this is a huge set of information so I'm going to narrow the scope by looking specifically at October and November 2016, just before the last election, only on r/politics and r/news. I want to look specifically at the frequency of certain keywords (maybe by day, corresponding with day-to-day news releases during the election) to try to answer these questions:


-Was reddit, like facebook, also hit by an enormous number of (ostensibly russian) bots posting pro-Trump comments? (This will be a more abstract and difficult question to answer conclusively).

-Across the entire 2-month span, how did the frequency of comments including the phrase 'Hillary's emails' or something similar rise and fall? If dates are compared to a timeline of events during the election, when and why would there be a surge in those comments?

-Looking at overall word frequency, what key buzzwords were most present during this time? What were people most concerned with?

-Again looking at overall word count, what are the political leanings of most reddit users and in what percentages? Would likely be difficult to empirically prove this, but political groups all have their own dogwhistles i.e. 'thoughts and prayers'.

I think it goes without saying that the compromise of American democracy through poorly moderated social media platforms remains serious and relevant, especially as the current election cycle spins up. To be able to point at this dataset and identify trends in public opinion, matched against a timeline of the election cycle, should demonstrate how easy it is to use social media as a tool for mass manipulation. The frequency with which comments appear that seem inauthentic or inhuman, i.e. a mess of jargon and buzzwords, will also serve as a strong indicator that someone or some group was intentionally wielding that tool against the American public and its democracy. I know that this has already been confirmed by government agencies who employ people with actual degrees and expertise, but there is always something to be learned, and going this route with the unbelievably massive dataset of reddit comments seems like a good start that's focused on a salient issue.
